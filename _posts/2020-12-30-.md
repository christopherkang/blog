Brief thought - types of distractions. [WIP]

I recently skimmed an [article](https://ideas.time.com/2012/09/12/does-listening-to-music-while-working-make-you-less-productive/) describing the costs of listening to music while working. I proudly had 50-60k minutes on Spotify over 2020, most of which is while working. Could this music really be dampening my performance?

More broadly, though, what types of distractions are truly *distracting* or anti-productive?

## Two types of distractions
This leads to two potential thoughts of distractions:
1. **Generative distractions**, or distractions which are internally driven and produced
2. **Consumptive distractions**, or distractions which are externally driven and consumed

One example of a generative distraction would be shower thoughts - my mind is certainly occupied in the shower, yet I don't accomplish significant work. 

For consumptive distractions, examples are plentiful: social media (especially TikToks), Youtube, TV,...
